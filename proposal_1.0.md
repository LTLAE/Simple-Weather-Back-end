## Background  
Nowadays, weather forecast is a vital to our daily life. Knowing what the weather will be like in the next few hours or days can help us plan or adjust our activities. We expect to give users a convenient and pleasant experience when they check the weather.  
<!-- Should we add more details? -->
In order to understand how software management works and practice our software management skills, we decided to develop a weather app. It will be suitable for our level and skills and would not be much too complex to handle.  
We are looking forward to manage this project in a professional way and push the process according to our learning progress.  

## Project description and scope  
- Topic: A web application (website) that provides weather forcast and other related information.  
- Goals: Show weather condition including weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed and so on according to user's demand. Such as specific location, time, etc. Meanwhile some revelant suggestions like what to wear and recommanded activities.  
- Scope: Our target is to present weather information in a user-friendly way. Users can access our app simply by a web browser. The application will only present basic information. Professional data like high-altitude wind speed, satellite radar reflectivity, cloud temperature and lightning information will not be included.  

## Function Requirements  
- The application will provide fundamental and accurate weather information to users.  
- The application will show information clearly and in a user-friendly way.  
- The application shall be able to search weather information by location.  
- The application can use the user's location to provide weather information.  
<!-- Should we add more details? -->

## Non-Functional Requirements  
- The application will need internet access to update weather information.    
- The application will need a web browser to render its interface.  
<!-- web browser requirements? Like 1GHz cpu, at least 2GB RAM ...-->
- If the user want to check the weather of current location, location service should be enabled.  

## Architecture and Technical approach  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: Python  
- Database: MySQL  <!-- Do we need a database?-->

## Risk identification  
- Server will need stable and reliable internet connection.  
- Weather information need to be updated in time.  
- The application may not be able to provide accurate weather information due to the 

## Budget and Timeline  
<!-- Need to be discussed. -->

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this weather app project aims to provide users with essential weather information in an intuitive and accessible way. We strive to ensure that users accurate information to their needs. The project will offer a valuable experience in software management and development. All in all, we look forward to completing the project and delivering a functional and reliable tool for users.

**Acceptance criteria**  

**Tools we decided to use**  
- WeChat  
The main communication tool.  
- Gitee as VCS  
_Put screenshot and link into slides._  
After discussion, we decided to use Gitee as our VCS. Since some of our group members living in China Mainland, comparing to GitHub, Gitee is more stable and convenient.  
- XMind online  
Put screenshot into slides.  
We use mind map to build our Work Breakdown Structure. XMind online is capable of online editing and collaboration, which is perfect for our group work.  
- Burn down chart  
We are still discussing the workflow to update the chart.
<!-- Can we make a Burn down chart before the first pre?-->
- Excel
Simple gannt chart and task list for time management.  

### 3.2. Issues and solutions by now  <!-- 1min-->
**Issue 1**  
Free api of OpenWeather can only get weather data of 5 days, as we initially planned to get 7 days.  
Solution: Since the frontend is in design and the database is still under construction, we changed the frontend design and database structure to adapt this change.  

**Issue 2**  <!-- Optional-->
